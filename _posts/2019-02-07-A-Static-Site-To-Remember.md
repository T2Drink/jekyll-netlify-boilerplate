# A test article.

There was quite a few things i wanted from a jekyll blog. To be honest,to find a service like Netlify, and 
not have to pay a penny, is just unbelievable and a great testament to how far the internet has come.

Starting a new Paragraph is a definite bonus. 
There is a sense of satisfaction in finding a complete workflow that works for publishing and everything else, without dumping a ton of money into it. I am currently writing this in Ia Writer, with all updates showing up instantly into my copy of Textastic. I can do any adding of inline code easier from textastic. I think i could easily tab in and add some  `inline code` if i wanted to.

I could also do some updates in here, then see them in IaWriter

I think the writing experience in IaWriter is by far the nicest i have found. I know now what people meant when they said that they couldnâ€™t really describe what it is about the interface that makes it such a nice experience. I guess you just haves to experience it for yourself
